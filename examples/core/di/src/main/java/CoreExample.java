/**
 * A module is a collection of bindings and a binding is a "recipe" of how to make an instance of certain type.
 * You simply define all these "recipes" with DSL.
 * <p>
 * - In this example you make a lambda which creates an instance of ConsoleMessageSenderImpl which is a recipe for it.
 * - Then you say that to create an instance of MessageSender you can use the ConsoleMessageSenderImpl, which is already known how to make.
 * - And then you add a recipe with a lambda for an Application instance, which depends on MessageSender, which is known to be made as a ConsoleMessageSenderImpl.
 * <p>
 * Keep in mind, that all of those "recipes" can be split into multiple modules, and you don't need to know an exact implementation of the MessageSender
 * interface, you just know that somewhere somebody provided a recipe for it. That is the whole point of the Dependency Injection paradigm.
 * <p>
 * One notable difference is that all the recipes are by default 'singletons' - meaning that
 * an object is created from the recipe at most once per its key per injector instance, cached and reused for any other recipes that depend on it.
