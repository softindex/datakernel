## DI

Extremely lightweight and fast-to-launch DI with no third-party dependencies. Even more powerful: support of nested scopes, 
singletons and instance factories, modules, optimized multi-threaded and single-threaded injectors. All reflection is 
completely abstracted out in a separate module and is entirely optional.

You can add this module to your project by inserting the following dependency to **pom.xml**:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.datakernel</groupId>
    <artifactId>datakernel-di</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.0-rc2</version>
</dependency>
```
