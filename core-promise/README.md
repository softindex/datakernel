## Promise

`Promise` is an efficient replacement of default Java `CompletionStage` interface and resembles JavaScript `Promise`, 
representing partial and possibly asynchronous computations of a large one. DataKernel *promises* are faster and better 
optimized, with minimal overhead, memory consumption and Garbage Collector load.

You can add this module to your project by inserting the following dependency to **pom.xml**:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.datakernel</groupId>
    <artifactId>datakernel-promise</artifactId>
    <version>3.2-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```
