## OT

OT was designed to create applications for collaborative editing. It is based on principles, which conceptually resemble 
Git, but with support of arbitrary user-defined data types and automatic conflict resolution using operational 
transformations (OT).

You can add this module to your project by inserting the following dependency to **pom.xml**:
