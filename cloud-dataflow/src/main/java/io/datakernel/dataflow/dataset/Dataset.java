/**
 * Represents distributed dataset which can span multiple partitions.
 * <p>
 * Typically it is implemented as result of some distributed operation:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Parallel query to some underlying distributed data source which is provided by 'environment'
 * <li>Transformation of some existing datasets
 * <li>Joins, unions, sorts of several datasets
 * <li>Repartitioned dataset downloaded from source dataset
 * </ul>
 * Internally this is achieved by creating a node on each server during compilation of Datagraph
