## Serializer

transferring data over wire or persisting it into a file system or database.

You can add this module to your project by inserting the following dependency to **pom.xml**:
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.datakernel</groupId>
    <artifactId>datakernel-serializer</artifactId>

</dependency>
```
